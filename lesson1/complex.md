# Complex Types

The four complex types we'll be discussing are:

* Classes
* Structs
* Enums
* Functions

## Classes

Classes represent everyday objects in code. More will be discussed when we talk about Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

```swift
class Vehicle {
    // Fields/Properties
    var model: String
    var year: Int

    // Methods/Behaviour
    func start() {...}
    func stop() {...}
}
```

Group common logic into an object
