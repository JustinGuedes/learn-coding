# Variables

Container or placeholder of a type/value.

## Constant vs 'Variable`

### Constant

Constants are variables that do not change over its lifespan. Always default to a constant until you are required to change the value, then change it to a 'variable' variable.

#### Swift

```swift
let pi = 3.14

// pi = 32 - Cannot assign to value 'y' is a 'let' constant
```

#### Typescript

```typescript
const pi = 3.14
```

### 'Variable'

'Variable' variable can change over its lifespan.

#### Swift

```swift
var counter = 0

counter = counter + 1
```

#### Typescript

```typescript
let counter = 0

counter = counter + 1
```

## Naming

Unique and descriptive to be able to identifier the purpose of the variable easily.
Most languages have their own naming convention, and most use lowerCamelCase and snakeCase.
Keep variable names within a good length, which could be anywhere between 3 to 20 letters.

> Note: Make sure you don't name variables after `keywords` from languages. Examples like: `for`, `in`, `if`, `let`

### Good Examples in `swift`:

```swift
let pi = 3.14
let letterLowercase = "h"
let dollarRandRate = 18.09
```

### Bad Examples in `swift`:

```swift
let g = "h"
let D$2 = 324
let ðŸ¤£ = 2.31
let dollarrandrate = 18.09
```
